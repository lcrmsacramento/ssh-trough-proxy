# What it does

This serves as a template to create aliases, to remotely connect to a server via an intermediate proxy server.
Add as many servers as needed, just adding an if-elif clause.

Add this code to your ``` .bashrc``` file, and update it:
``````
source ~/.bashrc
`````` 

## Examples
Using an alias:
```
jump alias
```
Using an ad-hoc (not explicitly specified) IP or hostname:
```
jump 1.23.45.67
```
